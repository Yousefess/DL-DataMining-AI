This repository contains the code for some courses I have passed in fields of Data Mining, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Python language. These courses are held by the [Khaje Nasir Toosi University (KNTU)](https://geomatics.kntu.ac.ir/) of Technology and [AIR CENTER](https://t.me/AIR_Center). The courses are as follows:

1. Data Mining
2. Introduction to Deep Learning
3. Advanced Deep Learning
4. Complete Deep Learning Course
5. Artificial Intelligence in Surveying Engineering
